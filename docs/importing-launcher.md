# Importing ppm launcher

When you access this webpage, I understand that your python script or custom ppm frontend might be attempting to import the ppm launcher. Unfortunately, ppm launcher **cannot** manage system packages.

You should import **ppm modules** and implement package management instead of importing the ppm launcher.

**If you are writing a python scripts or a new ppm frontend, please refer to the "ppm modules Tutorial" for more details.**
